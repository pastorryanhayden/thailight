Before we ever arrive in Thailand, we want to lay out a clear strategy for our ministry.  We want to be good stewards of the finances invested by churches into our ministry and good stewards of our lives; our lives are but a vapor and we want to live every moment making an impact for the Kingdom of God.

 

## OUR MINISTRY VISION

### 1. Learning the Language and Culture

> “…I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some.” (I Corinthians 9:22)

We will start off our first term on the field by taking the time to enroll in full-time language school. This is an essential step in missions work. How can we communicate the Good News of Christ and disciple people in the truths of the scriptures if we cannot communicate with them well? Thai is a tonal language, so the learner has to get used to recognizing the pitch of a word. Thai has five tones.  Learning a new script also presents a challenge, but most learners find it easier than they expect. Also, word order in Thai is similar to English. Basic grammar poses fewer problems than more familiar European languages because there are no verb or noun endings. There is a range of pronouns for expressing different levels of respect and familiarity. Some nouns and verbs have formal and informal variants.  It has 44 consonant letters and 15 vowel symbols that combine into at least 28 vowel forms.  Should be interesting!

 

### 2. Reaching the Lost

> “And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.”(Mark 16:15)


Ultimately, the purpose for missionary work is the fulfillment of the Great Commission to go and teach all nations, baptize them, and teach them all things.  Though providing food, medical care or meeting any other need is a good thing, they are purposeless if not paired with the priority of sharing salvation through Christ alone with a lost person.  Our strategy is to personally witness to people and help those people develop a passion to reach their own with the gospel.

 

### 3. Planting Churches

> “And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I WILL BUILD MY CHURCH; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.” (Matthew 16:18)


After we’ve learned the language and culture and begun seeing souls saved and discipled, we will establish a local indigenous church.  The church is indeed the pillar and ground of the truth.  It is through local churches around the globe that God is at work in communities and lives.  It’s in the context of local churches where true ministry is accomplished.  We’ll seek to establish local churches that multiply themselves through church planting throughout Thailand.

 

### 4. Training Men in Gospel Ministry

> “And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.” (II Timothy 2:2)


At the heart of all biblical missions work is the training of men to serve Christ in gospel ministry.  Our aim will be to employ Jesus’ model of “withness” to train men to do all the things which they have seen and heard through our ministry.  We will spend time with these men in formal Biblical education and hands on mentorship and involvement in the ministry to ensure that they are fully capable to handle the Word of God and shepherd His people in the context of the local church.  When the time comes, these men will lead the churches that we help plant.
