**Hello Churches and Prayer Partners,**

We are incredibly excited to announce that we have surpassed the 50% mark of our support goal! As of today, <u><strong>we are officially at 53%</strong></u>! This is a huge deal for us as we press forward toward our future ministry in Thailand.

We are praying that God allows us to raise the remainder of our support before this time next year. Would you pray with us about this?

&nbsp;

**During the last few months, God has allowed us to…**

Share the Gospel need in Thailand with 18 churches in IN, MO, OK, TX, KS, VA and FL.

* Safely traveled approximately 8,145 miles.
* See our support level rise to 53%.
* Celebrate Abigail's 8th birthday!

**This next 2 months…**

During the rest of October and November, we will be presenting our ministry and trying to be a blessing in 9 more churches throughout FL, CT, MA, NC and MD.&nbsp; Pray with us as I contact pastors to schedule meetings for 2018! Thank you for your faithful love, prayers and support!
