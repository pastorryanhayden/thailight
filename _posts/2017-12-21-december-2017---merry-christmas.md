**Merry Christmas!**

Our family would like to wish your family and church family a Blessed and Merry Christmas! This is truly a special time of year. I relish the opportunity to focus on the first coming of Christ and recalling the purpose for His coming, to seek and to save that which was lost. We really like the decorations, lights, family get-togethers and gifts, too!<br><br>![](/uploads/versions/350---x----350-350x---.jpg)

**So far, in November and December, God has allowed us to…**

* Share the Gospel need in Thailand with several churches in CT, MA, NC, MD, IN, and FL.
* Safely traveled approximately 6,500 miles.
* Through several new partnering churches, see our support level rise to 59%.
* TODAY IS AARON'S 10TH BIRTHDAY! We love him and are very proud of the young man he is becoming!

**The rest of this month (or year…)!**

The remainder of December, we will be in Indiana. Angel has been dealing with some health issues regarding her allergies specifically, though we think there may be other issues going on as well. On our last trip to Florida, she had a reaction that was closing her airway. She used her Epipen for the first time and we spent a few hours in the hospital with her until the swelling went down. We are trying to determine what the best next steps to take are and which doctors to see in order to get her healthy again. Please lift her up in prayer! I plan on sending out another prayer letter next month laying out some things that we'd like to see God do over the next year! God bless you all!

By His Grace,
