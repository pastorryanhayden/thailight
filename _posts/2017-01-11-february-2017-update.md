**Hello Churches and Prayer Partners, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;February 2017**
<br>

**Prayer Push to 50%**

This week, I’m launching what I’m calling a “Prayer Push” to get to 50% of our needed support by Easter. We would be ecstatic to arrive at the 50% mark of our support and deputation ministry. In order to meet that goal, 16 new churches will need to partner together with us in the next 8 weeks. Would you add this matter to your daily prayer list and begin praying with us? If we’ve been to your church and shared our burden for souls in Thailand, would you prayerfully consider being 1 of those 16 new churches?

<br>**This Past Month**

Over that past month, we’ve been privileged to travel around 4,100 miles to present our burden for Thailand in churches in Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky and Illinois. God has raised up new Great Commission partnerships with local churches which has raised our support level to 34%. We’re grateful for God’s churches and His provision!

In our family, we’ve had a lot to celebrate this past month. Angel and I celebrated our 15th wedding anniversary on January 5th, Alex had his 4th birthday on January 28th, I celebrated 20 years of salvation on February 2nd and Anna had her 6th birthday on February 11th. God has been so good to us! I posted a video on Facebook where I went to the place that I got saved and shared my testimony. You can watch it at https://goo.gl/FWXWkm.

<br>**This Coming Month**

This month, we took off from our home base in Indiana for our first real road trip of the year. We are going to be in several meetings and conferences all over the place. We’ll be in GA, NC, FL, TX, KS, and NE! It will be a long trip with a lot of driving, so pray that God would bless it with safety and fruitful ministry!

We’re incredibly grateful for you!

By His Grace,

Bryan and Angel Ries
