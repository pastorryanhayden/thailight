**Hello Churches and Prayer Partners,**

It’s such a pleasure serving Jesus! Through all of the highs and lows of life, He is always an ever present help in time of need. We have had a rough few weeks of illness sweeping through our family. Angel and I have both had a case of Strep and all of us have had a stomach bug we’ve dealt with (some of us twice). But, God has helped us through. It’s not easy being that sick on the road.

**Since our last letter, we have been able to…**

* Share the Gospel need in Thailand with 11 new churches in GA, NC, FL, TX, KS and NE. 7 of these were Conferences.
* Hear from 4 new supporting churches raising our support level to almost 39%
* With God’s protection, travel approximately 5,700 miles.
* Celebrate a 36th Birthday for Angel and an 11th Birthday for Andrew.

You’ll see here a map from Ray Avenue Baptist Church in Salina, KS (one of our newest supporting churches). During their Missions Conference, I was able to place our light firmly inside of Thailand. This was a special moment! Upon, reflection, it is a very symbolic gesture. Because of God’s call, our submission to that call, your support of that call through prayer and finances, the LIGHT OF CHRIST will shine a little brighter and further into the needy country of Thailand! Thank you for partnering with us!

**This coming month…**

We appreciate your prayers as we finally get to be back home after 8 straight weeks on the road. During the remainder of April, we’ll spend Resurrection Sunday at our home church and present the Gospel need in Thailand with 3 more churches in IN and OH.
