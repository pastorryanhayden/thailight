On October 13th, 2016, His Majesty the King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand passed away. Having reigned for 70 years, he was the only king that the vast majority of Thai people had ever known. He served as a father to the people and they in turn revered him as such. He expended his life with a sincere desire to do what is best for his people and nation. The entire nation is mourning the loss, so please be in prayer for Thailand and for the potentially turbulent political future of this nation where God has called us.

## Our Meetings

Through the month of September, we shared our heart for the souls of Thailand with churches in Texas, Oklahoma and Indiana while putting in a total of 3,928 miles on the road. At the beginning of September, our air conditioning went out again on our Suburban. God always provides the solutions to our problems! During a Sunday night service while we were with a church in Texas, they asked if we had any current prayer needs. I shared the need to get our A/C repaired and, after the service, they offered to get it repaired! Awesome, right? This month, we also applied for our Passports so we can take our survey trip in December. We were told that it would be a 6-8 week process, but we received them back in less than 2 weeks! We’ve been speaking with missionaries on the field making plans and preparations for the trip! We’ve also had several new churches take us on for support this month.  We’re now at 24% of our support need! Thanks for praying.

## Where we’ll be this month…

Throughout the month of October, which is a very busy missions month for many churches and missionaries, we will be presenting our burden for Thai souls in Indiana, Kentucky, and throughout Alabama. Be praying for these meetings. It is our deep-seated desire to serve the Lord in these churches and stir up within them a desire to do more to reach this world of more than 7 Billion souls with the Gospel while there is still time!

## Prayer Requests

We’re asking God for these requests:

* Safety as we travel.

* God to continue to fill our deputation schedule. We are now actively scheduling for 2017.

* Churches to prayerfully consider supporting us. We are currently at 24% of our needed support!
    
* That souls will be saved and that we can be a blessing to churches while we serve God on deputation.

* We’re praying about a different housing option for our family for the rest of deputation.

* My wife’s Grandfather has only been given a short time to live.  Be praying for the family and me as I perform the funeral when the time comes.

God bless you!
