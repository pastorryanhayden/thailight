# Hello Churches and Prayer Partners,

Home. You would think that, for a missionary family, that word starts to get confusing once they reach the foreign field. What can be surprising is how confusing that word can get even when you are a missionary family in the deputation stage of ministry. For many families, a lot of time is spent in missions apartments, prophet’s chambers, hotels, other people’s homes, etc.

The month of July was spent at “home” for us. Indiana. We had a full schedule of meetings around our home state and we were able to spend a week at Family Camp refreshing and growing together as a family.

## Our Meetings

Through the months of July and August, we shared our heart for souls in Thailand with churches in Indiana, Missouri, Colorado and Arkansas. We traveled a total of 7,765 miles. It was such a blessing to be in Colorado for a week. From Sunday to Sunday, we were in 4 different churches and the oldest church was just celebrating 8 years of existence. God is still at work leading new churches to be planted here in the United States. That’s encouraging to us foreign missionaries as well!

It was great to present our ministry in Hope Baptist Church in Loveland, CO and catch up with some college friends, The Barclays, who started the church 5 years ago.

## Update on our survey trip

We’re excited to announce that our flights have been purchased for our survey trip to Thailand. We will fly out on December 6th, 2016 and return on December 20th, 2016. Thank you to every church and friend that gave to make this trip possible!

## Where we’ll be this month…

During September, we are in Texas to take part in 4 days of training with Global Independent Baptist Missions. We will also be sharing our burden in churches in Texas, Oklahoma, Ohio, and Indiana. We still have a couple of services available, so please pray that we can fill them! Thanks!

## Prayer Requests

We’re asking God for these requests:

* Safety as we travel.
* God to continue to fill our deputation schedule.
* Churches to prayerfully consider supporting us.
* That souls will be saved and that we can be a blessing to churches while we serve God on deputation.
* We’re praying about a different housing option for our family for the rest of deputation.
* PRAISE! God provided the needed amount to purchase our airfare for our survey trip!


God bless you!

By His Grace,
