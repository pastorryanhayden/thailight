**Hello Pastors, Churches and Prayer Partners,**<br>We hope and pray that your 2018 is off to a wonderful start! God has been good to us. We want to thank all of you for your prayers for Angel's health issues. So far, it seems that Angel has been dealing with allergies and a major flare up of acid reflux. She has been on a very restrictive elimination diet and has been advised to try a change in a few of her prescriptions to see if she experiences relief. She has seen some improvement, praise the Lord! Since the middle of December, I have been doing most of the traveling to meetings without the family. We're hopeful that we can begin to travel together again very soon! Thanks for your continued prayers.<br><br>Also, at the beginning of January Andrew (our oldest son) had a procedure to destroy the growth plates above and below his left knee so that his leg length discrepancy can even out over time. Everything seems to have been successful. The doctors expect that his 1 1/2 inch discrepancy will be decreased to around 1 cm.<br><br>We utilize the Health Cost Sharing service provided by Samaritan Ministries. These health needs are considered pre-existing conditions and they do not cover them. Please pray with us for God's provision to meet the financial obligations for these things!

**So far, in January and February, God has allowed us to...**

* Share the Gospel need in Thailand with several churches in IL, IN, MO and FL.
* Safely travel approximately 1,950 miles by car and 3,600 by plane.
* Through several new partnering churches, see our support level rise to 62%.
* Celebrate our 15th wedding anniversary.
* Celebrate Alexander's 5th birthday and Anna's 7th birthday!

**The rest of this month and March...**

During the rest of February and through March, we will be traveling and presenting our ministry to Thailand in several church services and Missions Conferences in FL, VA, and GA. We're praying that we will be doing these travels together as a family rather than apart. We'll also be celebrating Angel's birthday and Andrew's 12th birthday. Will you pray that God will continue to lead churches to partner together with us? We're incredibly grateful for your love, prayers and support. We love you all!
